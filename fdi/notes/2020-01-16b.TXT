I found this solution :

In C:\FDCONFIG.SYS :

Not useful to solve the problem with SYST¬ME but useful for other things,
I suppose :
COUNTRY=033,858,C:\FDOS\BIN\COUNTRY.SYS

In C:\FDAUTO.BAT :
Not useful to solve the problem with SYST¬ME but useful for other things,
I suppose :
SET LANG=FR
...

Solve the problem with SYST¬ME :
LH DISPLAY CON=(EGA,,1)
MODE CON CODEPAGE PREPARE=((858) C:\FDOS\CPI\EGA.CPX)
MODE CON CODEPAGE SELECT=858

Not useful to solve the problem with SYST¬ME but necessary to use french
keyboard and € (AltGr+e) :

LH KEY FR,858

Could somebody modify the installer to have this configuration when installing
FreeDOS with a french keyboard, please ?
