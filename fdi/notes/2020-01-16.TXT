Sorry to say that, but in 2020 users expect a proper COUNTRY (and codepage)
setting after installation.

I chose German keyboard during installation and the installation process was
done completely in German language, which is very nice, but the installer then
writes COUNTRY=001,858,C:\FDOS\BIN\COUNTRY.SYS to CONFIG.SYS.

I would expect at least !COUNTRY=049,,C:\FDOS\BIN\COUNTRY.SYS.

So, please add another screen to ask the user for the country he lives in and
set COUNTRY accordingly during installation.

Cheers,
Robert
